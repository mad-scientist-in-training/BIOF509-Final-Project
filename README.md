# BIOF509-Final-Project

# Introduction
Parkinson’s Disease is a neurodegenerative disease which affects more than 200,000 people in the United States alone each year. This disease is an enormous financial and emotional burden on the families of those suffering from Parkinson’s Disease.  While there are some treatments, there is currently no cure. Recently, effort has been made to determine early signs of Parkinson’s disease so that individuals may seek help and may mitigate the development of symptoms, increasing their chance of living longer and healthier. While there have been advancements in this field, it is likely that there are a whole range of symptoms and characteristics which define a person’s risk of getting Parkinson’s disease later; put another way, it is likely that a combination of features may indicate whether a person currently has the early symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. 

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use supervised machine learning on a speech pattern dataset of healthy controls versus people with the early signs of Parkinson's Disease to predict which category (class) individuals fall into, in the hope of being able to use this information as part of routine diagnostics in the future.

# Data Description
The dataset used in this project was imported from Kaggle, entitled "Early Biomarkers of Parkinson's Disease" (uploaded by def me(x), view dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/ruslankl/early-biomarkers-of-parkinsons-disease). The original dataset can be found from the following publication: "Automated analysis of connected speech reveals early biomarkers of Parkinson’s disease in patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder" by Jan Hlavnička, Roman Čmejla, Tereza Tykalová, Karel Šonka, Evžen Růžička & Jan Rusz @ nature.com
The dataset represents multiple speech patterns (as well as other factors not used in this analysis) that are potential marker's of patients with early signs of Parkinson's Disease, a sleep disorder, and healthy controls. In this analysis, only the Parkinson's Disease (P) and Healthy Controls (H) participant information was used.
