# BIOF509-Final-Project
The final project for Intro to Machine Learning BIOF509
Parkinson’s Disease is a neurodegenerative disease which affects more than 200,000 people in the United States alone each year. This disease is an enormous financial and emotional burden on the families of those suffering from Parkinson’s Disease.  While there are some treatments, there is currently no cure. Recently, effort has been made to determine early signs of Parkinson’s disease so that individuals may seek help and may mitigate the development of symptoms, increasing their chance of living longer and healthier. While there have been advancements in this field, it is likely that there are a whole range of symptoms and characteristics which define a person’s risk of getting Parkinson’s disease later; put another way, it is likely that a combination of features may indicate whether a person currently has the early symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. The purpose of this project is to use supervised machine learning to build a diagnostic profile of patients with or without early onset Parkinson’s disease, in the hope of being able to use this information as part of routine diagnostics in the future.
